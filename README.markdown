# The basic idea

Write your presentations in a text editor.

- No fancy WYSIWIG editor
- No hand-written HTML
- Just text (Markdown)

Separate slides with `***`.

# For example

This is the source for the previous slide:

```markdown

# How it works

Slidedown parses Markdown, then splits up the HTML into slides by splitting at
every `<HR>` tag.

***

# How it works

Every slide has a *layout* which is inferred by the elements making up that
slide.

***

# For example, this slide has an `<h1>` and an `<h2>`
## So Slidedown infers that the layout should be like this

***

# Navigation

You can navigate left/right through the slides using the keyboard.

You can also click on either side of the screen, or use swipe gestures
on mobile devices.

***

# How to use it

```javascript
// Fetch the source Markdown using an AJAX request
Slidedown.fromXHR('path/to/slides.markdown');

// Or if you have the Markdown in a string already
Slidedown.fromMarkdown('markdown source');

// Or if you actually have HTML rendered from Markdown already
Slidedown.fromHTML('html source');
```

***

# How to use it

By default, slides will be dumped directly into the document's `<body>` element.
You can change this:

```javascript
var slides = document.getElementById('slides');
Slidedown.fromMarkdown('markdown source').to(slides);
```

Or even just:

```javascript
Slidedown.fromMarkdown('markdown source').to('#slides');
```

# The End
